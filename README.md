# Restore

A desktop wellness assistant that monitors cognitive overload using simulated heart rate data and offers short interventions to help you refocus.

## Run full stack

To start the frontend, backend, and heart-rate controller together:

```bash
npm install
npm run start:all
```

**First-time setup:**

- **Windows:** `cd backend` → `python -m venv .venv` → `.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **macOS/Linux:** `cd backend` → `python3 -m venv .venv` → `.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`

The launcher uses `backend/.venv` automatically if present.

This launches the Vite dev server, Flask API (port 5000), and the controller GUI. See [controller/README.md](controller/README.md) for syncing the controller with the app.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Built with Electron + React + Vite (frontend) and Flask + SQLite (backend), bundled into a single macOS app via PyInstaller.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.x with a virtual environment at `.venv/`
- Install Python dependencies:
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
  ```

---

## Development

Start the Vite dev server and Electron together. The backend (Flask) is spawned automatically by Electron on port 5001.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend must be able to run via `python app.py` from the `backend/` directory. Make sure your `.venv` is activated or `python` resolves to the correct interpreter.

---

## Production Build (macOS)

The full build compiles the Python backend into a standalone binary via PyInstaller, then packages everything into a macOS `.app` using electron-builder.

```bash
npm run build
```

This runs the following steps in order:

1. `npm run build:backend` — PyInstaller bundles `backend/app.py` into `backend-dist/restore-backend`
2. `tsc` — TypeScript compilation
3. `vite build` — builds the React frontend and Electron main/preload
4. `electron-builder` — packages everything into `release/`

Output files:
- `release/mac-arm64/Restore.app` — unpacked app (use for quick testing)
- `release/Restore-0.0.0-arm64.dmg` — DMG installer

---

## Running the Release on macOS

Because the app is unsigned, macOS Gatekeeper will block it. Strip the quarantine flag before opening:

```bash
xattr -cr release/mac-arm64/Restore.app
open release/mac-arm64/Restore.app
```

> The DMG (`release/Restore-0.0.0-arm64.dmg`) may fail to open on macOS Sequoia (15.x) with error -10673 due to Gatekeeper restrictions on unsigned DMGs. Use the `.app` directly from `release/mac-arm64/` instead.

To verify the backend started successfully:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health
# Expected: {"status": "ok"}
```

---

## Quitting the App Safely

Always quit via the **tray icon** (menu bar) → **Quit**. This triggers the `before-quit` handler which cleanly stops the embedded Flask backend before Electron exits.

Avoid force-quitting (Cmd+Q on the window, or Activity Monitor force kill), as this can leave the backend process running and holding port 5001.

If port 5001 is stuck after an unclean exit:

```bash
lsof -ti :5001 | xargs kill -9
```

## Cleaning Build Artifacts

```bash
npm run clean
```

Removes `dist/`, `release/`, `backend-dist/`, and `build/` (PyInstaller work directory).

## Backend API

The Flask backend runs on `http://localhost:5001` and exposes:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/health` | Health check |
| POST | `/api/heart-rate` | Submit a heart rate reading |
| GET | `/api/heart-rate/session/:id` | Get all readings for a session |
| GET | `/api/heart-rate/latest?session_id=` | Get latest reading for a session |
| POST | `/api/journal` | Submit a journal entry |
| GET | `/api/journal/session/:id` | Get all journal entries for a session |
| POST | `/api/session-summary` | Generate/update session summary |
| GET | `/api/session-summary/:id` | Get session summary |

SQLite database is stored at `~/Library/Application Support/Restore/app.db` when running the packaged app.
